# Blog Post Writing Style Guide: Reflective Practitioner's Log

This guide defines the writing style for posts on Neyas Guruswamy's Personal Wiki. The goal is to document the learning journey in Data Engineering for personal reference, fellow learners, and potential employers.

## Core Idea

Frame posts as entries in a learning log or journal, documenting the journey through concepts and projects "out loud."

## Tone

**Professional Conversational:**

* Write as if explaining to a curious colleague or fellow learner.
* Use "I" and share thought processes, challenges, and breakthroughs.
* Maintain clarity and technical accuracy.
* Avoid overly casual language/slang but keep it approachable.

## Content Structure

1. **Hook:** State the problem, concept, or project goal. *Why* this topic?
2. **The Journey:** Describe the steps taken. Integrate reflections:
    * Initial approaches and obstacles encountered.
    * Debugging process and "aha!" moments.
    * Comparisons between tools/methods.
    * Analogies or ways of thinking that helped understanding.
3. **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Include relevant code snippets, diagrams, or screenshots. Explain the *what* and *why* of the code in context.
4. **Outcome & Key Learnings:** Summarize achievements, what worked/didn't, and key takeaways.
5. **Next Steps/Open Questions (Optional):** Mention future explorations or remaining questions.

## Audience Focus

* **Self:** Detailed process serves as personal documentation.
* **Learners:** Relatable challenges and shared breakthroughs.
* **Employers:** Demonstrates problem-solving, curiosity, self-direction, communication.

## Post Variety

Use Hugo `categories` (e.g., "Tutorial", "Project Update", "Deep Dive") to indicate post type while maintaining the core reflective style.

## Goal Feeling

Convey curiosity, discovery, self-taught drive, and practical application.
