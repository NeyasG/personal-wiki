## Test hard. Test often

If there is one thing I wish I learned earlier in my programming journey, it would be: 

> **DON'T. SKIP. TESTING.**

Well now I'm slightly older and perhaps slightly wiser, I'm starting to see the benefits of approaching a programming problem from a *testing first* workflow. Today in my work I was building out a metadata system to programmatically gather metadata from external sources (yeah okay... it's Excel ðŸ˜”) and parse them into a standardised format that could be applied to table comments and table tags within [Unity Catalog](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog).
