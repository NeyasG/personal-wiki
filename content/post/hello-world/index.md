> Welcome to my personal blog! This space serves as my personal wiki and progress tracker as I dive into the world of Data Engineering, and software development. Stay a while and listen!

### A little bit about me

Graduating in Mechanical Engineering from Heriot-Watt University in 2018 may lead some down the path of industry, working their way to a chartered engineering certification and paving the way for a career in companies building bridges, cars, or machines. My journey however started off quite differently, with a stint in the professional video game industry.

Playing for an eSports team for a living was quite the unorthodox career, but it taught me a few things which I found useful now I'm working in what I would previously call a "boring" 9-5. The non-stop competitive gauntlet I was immersed in daily solved a lot of what I was lacking in University. Drive. So after *retiring* from competitive eSports and stumbling into the world of data engineering by almost chance (A story for another post), I find myself using that drive to tickle the problem solving part of my brain, building data pipelines, untangling strange behaviour and solving data puzzles.

### What's in the pipeline?

Expect posts covering topics on [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) and any other tools and platforms I encounter as I build up my experience. I'll be documenting my personal projects, challenges and all, the first of which is a simulated music streaming application (think Spotify) ingesting data in real time using Apache Kafka and Spark structured streaming to create a live dashboard.

For anyone stumbling on this blog, whether that be fellow Data Engineers and devs, or LinkedIn connections or if I'm lucky, potential employers, thank you for reading, and I hope you've found something useful while here!
